New Repo: RDE-TEMPLATES
New CodePipeline : RDE-TEMPLATES-PIPELINE
NEW ARTIFACT : RDE-TEMPLATES -- please note that this has a KMS key 

Rani I am sending you the templates for creating artifact bucket and for creating the rde templates pipeline

Next Steps: 

Create a new role that can be exported as rde:roles:templates:pipelinerole - should have access to the KMS 
Change the attached pipeline template to have the new role. 
Check if the Source setp of the pipeline is successful. We do not need the Build step in this case.
